  <p class="sansserif">Being the Background and Ambitions of Daniel P. Martin: A COM 530 project</p>

  <p class="serif"><strong>Background:</strong> I come from a family of academics &mdash; my mother and
  father are professors of cultural anthropology and industrial archaeology, respectively,
  and my younger sister holds a PhD in public health. I grew up in a small college town in
  the Upper Peninsula of Michigan called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houghton,_Michigan">
  Houghton</a>, home of <a href="http://www.mtu.edu">Michigan Technological University</a>.
  Michigan Tech is also my alma mater; I studied Scientific and Technical Communication,
  graduating in 2003. The STC program exposed me to many different facets of communication,
  including Web and multimedia design, publications management, rhetoric, editing, and more.</p>

  <p class="serif"><small>(When I first studied Web design, CSS was the absolute newest cutting edge development,
  the  last thing we covered in class, and I could never fully wrap my head around how it
  was intended to work.)</small></p>

  <p class="serif">Upon graduation I moved to Chicago and proceeded to work a series of temp jobs. I
  proofread financial documentation at a publishing house, updated Web pages at a nonprofit,
  and even ran and got coffee for execs (for a day, before I quit). I was later hired to a
  full-time position at the <a href="http://press.uchicago.edu/index.html">University of Chicago Press</a>.
  I worked in the Astronomy Journals Group on the journals of the American Astronomical
  Society. Specifically, I coordinated peer review, which meant I worked extensively in
  scientific papers written in LaTeX markup, fixed all manner of problems with graphics,
  and generally kept track of problems with dozens of journal submissions per day.</p>

  <p class="serif">Most recently I worked for the Press' Journals Production Group where I was responsible
  for several academic publications in a variety of disciplines. Among other duties, I used
  a variety of tools including text editors (emacs 4 lyfe btw) to edit XHTML code that went
  into the e-book editions of my journals. I did a lot of other work besides that, but the
  relevancy is what I'm going for here.</p>

  <p class="serif"><strong>Ambitions</strong> For a while, I felt like I had hit a wall at the Press, so I
  applied to IIT as a way to get over that wall. Here, I hope to broaden my abilities both
  technically and rhetorically, investigate new topics, and try to combine what I've learned
  in my working life with all this new information to come up with something bigger and
  better.</p>

  <p class="serif"><small>(And I am <em>definitely</em> going to sort out CSS in this class.)</small></p>
